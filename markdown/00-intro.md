<!-- Note -->
Yes, I know I'm the person between you and your drinks. I do
acknowledge that. And I also understand that I might be the person
between you and your hummus. Which in this country is probably even
worse. And then, so you might be thinking, what on earth is this guy
talking about? And why is he here? This is, after all, a technology
conference. And not only that, it's a DevOps meeting. So that means
that we're all about incrementally improving things, gradually
changing and reimplementing things without breaking them. Where's the
room for creativity in that?

And I'll forgive you for thinking that, because there are two very
common misconceptions about creativity. They're both very wrong, but
they're very, very common. The one misconception is that a creativity
is somehow the domain of the arts, that it happens in painting, music,
drama, dance, fiction, poetry, etc. But nowhere else. And the second
misconception is that creativity happens in big leaps, as in Mozart
writing a new Symphony or or Stephen King writing a new novel. Nothing
could be further from the truth. Both of those things could not be
further from the truth.
